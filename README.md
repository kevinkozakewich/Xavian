Here is the beginning to my WPF application.

Purpose: A sandbox environment to learn and add new WPF features.

Inside we have a:
- Simple 3-page WPF application,
- Entity framework with auto-database creation/population upon startup,
- Services which are very easy to set up through <T> typing helper classes,
  allowing immediate availability of crud operations per table,
- Easy table-based permissions configuration/retrieval through IQueryables,
- Security validating the user has permission,
- Foundation for authentication via Google and Microsoft JWT tokens,
- Azure Key Vault for storing of database connection strings/passwords,
- Ability to configure the application through appsettings.json.
